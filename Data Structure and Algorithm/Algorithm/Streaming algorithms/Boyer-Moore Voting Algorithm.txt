To find the majority of a sequence of elements.
TC: O(n)
SC: O(1)

The majority element of a sequence is the element that appears more than floor(n/2) times.

Starting from the beginning of the sequence, take the first element as the majority element.
Iterate through the sequence, count the number of the "majority element" and the "non-majority element".
When the two counts are equal, drop the whole suffix subsequence, start from the next element again.
When reaching the end of the sequence, the current "majority element" would be the real majority element.
