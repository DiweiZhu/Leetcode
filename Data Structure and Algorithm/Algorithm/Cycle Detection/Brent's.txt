Another two pointer method.

Fix the slow pointer, move the faster pointer, recording the distance between them.
If the distance reaches the current upper bound, double the upper bound, move the slow pointer to the fast pointer. The upper bound is initialized as 1.
If the two pointers meet, the cycle is found, the current distance between the pointers is the length of the cycle.
To find the entrance of the cycle, put slow point to the head and put fast point a cycle length away from the slow pointer. Move them one step a time until they meet.
