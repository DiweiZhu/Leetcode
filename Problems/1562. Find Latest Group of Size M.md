Description
================
* Given data: A length-n array with value 1 to n in random order, an int m between 1 and n
* Target: imagine another length-n array originally set to zero, fill it with 1s at indices following the order in the given array, return the last step that there exists a subarray with exactly m continuous 1s.
* Restraint: no restraint
* Others: length <= 10^5

Discussion
================
n=10^5, so n^2 is unacceptable. 
Instead of putting 1s into the array, we can reverse the order and take 0s out of the array.

1. Put 1s into the array
Each time we put an 1 into the array, we count the length of the countinously 1s around it. After counting this length, we should try to store it to avoid redoing it each round, which leads to n^2. 
Important observation: A new 1 only touch the ends of a existing 1s subarray. So we can just save the length of the 1s arrays on their two ends. Then each time a new 1 added, we can instantly get the length information, resulting in O(n) solution.

2. Take 1s out of the array
Each time we take an 1 out of the array, we still need to know some information about the length. This time we cannot utillize the ends because we create ends. We cannot store the length information on every index either because that means we need to update every index every round. 
With the concept of utillizing the ends, we can see that each end must be next to a 0 (except index 0 and n-1). We can store the indices of the zeros, and use binary search to find adjacent 0s. This is O(nlogn).

1. Put 1s into the array

```md
class Solution {
public:
    int findLatestStep(vector<int>& arr, int m) {
        int n = arr.size();
        if (m == n) return n;
        
        vector<int> l(n + 2, 0);
        
        int res = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) {
            int id = arr[i];
            
            if (l[id - 1] == m || l[id + 1] == m) {
                res = max(res, i);
            }
            
            int cur = 1 + l[id - 1] + l[id + 1];
            
            l[id - l[id - 1]] = cur;
            l[id + l[id + 1]] = cur;
            
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

2. Take 1s out of the array

```md
class Solution {
public:
    int findLatestStep(vector<int>& arr, int m) {
        int n = arr.size();
        if (m == n) {
            return n;
        }
        
        set<int> zeros;
        
        zeros.insert(0);
        zeros.insert(n + 1);
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i --) {
            int id = arr[i];
            
            auto right = zeros.upper_bound(id);
            
            if (*right - id - 1 == m || id - *(--right) - 1 == m) {
                return i;
            }
            
            zeros.insert(id);
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```
