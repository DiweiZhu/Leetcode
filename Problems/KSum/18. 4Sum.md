* Target: find all unique quadruplets in the array, which sum up to target.
* Restraint: all quaduplets in the returned vector should be unique
* Others:

Discussion
================
Like 2Sum and 3Sum, we can use hash table or two pointers. Just add another round of iteration.

We need to compare these two solution. Both are O(n^3) in time, but hash table is O(n) in space while two pointers is O(1).\
The advantage of two pointers is that it's convenient to deal with duplicates. The advantage of hash table is that it can do further trade off between time and space.\
We can get all possible sums of two elements form the array and store them in a hash map, with key as the sum and value as the indices. Now this problem becomes "2Sum", only that the elements becomes the sums of two elements we've just calculated. The time complexity and space complexity are both O(n^2).

The K sum problem can be solved by using these three methods:\
Two pointer: O(n^(k-1)) in time and O(1) in space.
Hash table 1: O(n^(k-1)) in time and O(n) in space.
Hash table 2: O(n^(k / 2)) for even k and O(n^((k - 1)/2 + 1)) for odd k in time, O(n^(k / 2)) in space (integer division here).
