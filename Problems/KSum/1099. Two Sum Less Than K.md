Description
================
* Given data: an array of integer, unsorted
* Target: return the maximum sum of two different items in the array, if doesn't exist, return -1.
* Restraint: none
* Others: 1 <= A[i] <= 1000

Discussion
================
Cannot use hash table here because we do not have a specific value to search. In other words, for each number, we are trying to find a number from the array that sums up smaller than but as close as possible to the target.

Hash table cannot do this, but binary search and two pointers can. Two pointwers is better than binary search because of the same reason in two sum.

Since this problem need to sort the array, and the range of the numbers is small, we can use count sort.

Final Code
================

```md
class Solution {
public:
    int twoSumLessThanK(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        sort(A.begin(), A.end());
        
        int n = A.size();
        
        int l = 0, r = n - 1;
        int res = -1;
        while (l < r) {
            while (l < r && A[l] + A[r] >= K) {
                r --;
            }
            if (A[l] + A[r] < K) {
                res = max(res, A[l] + A[r]);
                l ++;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
