Description
================
* Given data: one array of integers
* Target: find all unique triplest which sums up to the specific target
* Restraint: the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets
* Other: 

Related Topics
================
* array
* hash table
* two pointers

Abstraction
================
* Brute force: enumerating all triplets
* What is used multiple times: each element is used for n^2 times
* What is wasted: like in two sum, we dont care the sum of arbitrary three elements. We only care for each element e, if there exists a pair of elements which gives the sum of target - e. It's like we're doing 2Sum to the rest of the array.

So, hash table.
